A healthy diet gives your child the nutrition they need to grow. Plus, the foods you serve now will shape your child's tastes and eating patterns for years to come.

It's a familiar refrain: The eating habits you establish now set your child up for a lifetime of healthy eating, which helps protect them from cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease later in life. Of course, parenting realities often defeat your best intentions. As kids grow, they may show off their budding independence through picky eating – a normal (if frustrating) part of child development.

Try not to get discouraged. You won't be able to get your child to eat every bite at every meal, and that's okay. Instead of enforcing strict dietary rules (which can backfire and make your child dislike certain foods even more), try to focus on the bigger goal. That is, introducing your child to a variety of nutrient-dense foods at an early age to help develop taste preferences.

Keep introducing foods in various preparations, alongside other foods you know your child enjoys. And be a good role model, eating the same types of foods you're offering your child. As long as you're consistently serving a variety of options throughout the week, your child will get the nutrition they need.

Keep in mind, too, that every child has unique dietary needs, and certain foods are more appropriate at certain ages. To make sure your child gets enough of all the right stuff, see these tips for healthy snacks and meals, and follow the guidelines below.

## Nutrition for kids ages 2 to 8

Where should your child's building-block calories come from? Ideally from a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy products, and protein foods. (Some calories may sneak in as treats and sweets, too.)

Here's a quick overview of what your child needs every day from each food group. Keep in mind that these are estimates, and your child may need more or less depending on how active they are or whether they're still breastfeeding. Your child's doctor can answer any questions you have about your child's diet.

## Vegetables
It doesn't matter how you serve them: Cooked or raw; fresh, canned, or frozen. Over the course of a week, offer your child lots of different-colored vegetables. This helps ensure that they're getting all the nutrients each vegetable has to offer – including fiber, potassium, and vitamins A and C, to name a few. These nutrients support your child's whole body, from the heart and digestive system to the eyes, skin, teeth, and gums.

Focus on dark green veggies (broccoli, spinach) and orange and red veggies (tomatoes, peppers, carrots, squash). Remember that beans, peas, and lentils are a double bonus, since they count as both a type of vegetable and a protein food. Other vegetables to add to the mix include starchy veggies (potatoes, corn) and a rainbow of other nutrient-rich options (cauliflower, avocado, cucumber, mushrooms).

### erving sizes
Count vegetable servings in cups. A 1-cup serving of vegetables is considered to be:

- 1 cup of raw or cooked vegetables
- 1 cup of vegetable juice
- 2 cups of raw, leafy greens

### Kids ages 2 to 4

**Aim for:** 1 to 2 cups daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1/2 cup oven-baked sweet potato fries with lunch or for snack, and 1/4 cup each cooked broccoli and red pepper strips at dinner.
- 1/2 cup mashed baked potato with 1/4 cup chopped tomato for lunch, and 1/4 cup cooked peas with dinner.
- 1/4 cup cooked mushrooms with a scrambled egg for breakfast, 1/2 cup cooked green beans at lunch, 1/4 cup sliced cucumbers with 1 tablespoon hummus for snack, and 1/4 cup sautéed spinach with dinner.

### Kids ages 5 to 8

**Aim for:** 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1 cup chopped salad greens with 1/4 cup sliced cherry tomatoes at lunch, 1/4 cup cauliflower with 1 tablespoon hummus for snack, and 1/4 cup cooked corn with dinner.

- 3/4 cup low-sodium tomato juice at breakfast, 1/2 sweet potato at lunch, and 1/2 cup cooked broccoli with dinner.

 -1/2 cup cooked squash at lunch, one half small ear of corn on the cob at lunch, 1/2 cup cooked baby spinach with dinner.

## Fruit
Like vegetables, fruits offer fiber, potassium, vitamin C, and folate – and most of us don't get enough of these essential nutrients. Fruits also help keep your child regular and support heart health.

Frozen and canned fruit is just as healthy as fresh fruit, as long as it's packed in water or juice with no added sugar or syrup. Choose fruit over fruit juice because it contains fiber minus the added sugar. When you do serve it, opt for 100-percent fruit juice.

### Serving sizes
Count fruit servings in cups. One cup of fruit equals:

- 1 cup of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit
- 1/2 cup dried fruit
- one small apple
- one large banana
- one medium grapefruit

## Kids ages 2 to 4
**Aim for:** 1 to 1 1/2 cups daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1/4 cup sliced strawberries at breakfast, 1/4 cup grapes (cut in quarters) for snack, 1/2 cup applesauce for dessert.
- 1/4 cup blueberries with breakfast, 1/2 cup canned pears in juice (cut up) for lunch or snack, 1/4 cup chopped frozen raspberries for dessert.
- 1/2 cup sliced banana at breakfast or snack time, 1/2 cup (or one 4-ounce snack container) fruit cocktail with no sugar added for dessert. (Check to make sure pieces are small enough for young children, and chop smaller if necessary.)

## Kids ages 5 to 8
**Aim for:** 1 to 2 cups daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1 cup sliced banana at breakfast, 1/4 cup raisins for snack, 1/2 cup sliced strawberries for dessert.
- Half a large apple (sliced) for snack, 1/2 cup orange sections with lunch, 1/4 cup canned peaches for dessert.
- Half a grapefruit with breakfast, 1/2 cup applesauce with lunch, 1/2 cup berries for dessert.

### Grains

The best types of grains serve up complex carbohydrates, fiber, B vitamins (like folate), and minerals (like iron). They help give your child long-lasting energy, prevent constipation, and protect your little one's heart, among other benefits.

There are two types of grains: whole grains and refined grains (although some processed foods are made from both whole grains and refined grains).

Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel and have more fiber, iron, and B vitamins than refined grains. Examples of whole grains include whole wheat flour and bread, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, brown rice, and whole-wheat pasta.

Refined grains have been processed to give them a finer texture and a longer shelf life. Refined grain products include white flour and bread, white rice, and most kinds of pasta.

While many refined grains are enriched with certain B vitamins and iron, they don't contain the fiber found in whole grains. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends choosing whole grains for at least half of the grains in your diet.

## Serving sizes

Count your child's servings in 1-ounce equivalents, which is about:

- one slice of regular bread
- 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal
- 1/2 cup of cooked pasta, cereal, or grains (such as couscous or quinoa)

## Kids ages 2 to 4

**Aim for:** 3- to 5-ounce equivalents daily, half of which come from whole grains

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- One slice whole wheat toast at breakfast, mini pita sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup whole wheat pasta for dinner.
- 1 cup toasted oat cereal for breakfast, half sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup brown rice with dinner.
- 1/2 cup oatmeal for breakfast, 6-inch whole wheat tortilla wrap for lunch, 1 small whole wheat roll with dinner.

## Kids ages 5 to 8
**Aim for:** 4 to 6-ounce equivalents daily, half of which come from whole grains

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1 cup oatmeal for breakfast, whole-wheat bread sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup brown rice with dinner.
- One whole grain mini bagel at breakfast, five whole wheat crackers with a snack, open faced sandwich for lunch, English muffin pizza for dinner.
- One whole wheat pancake for breakfast, two rye crispbreads with a snack, grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked bulgur with dinner.

## Dairy
At birth, babies have about 300 bones that fuse together into just 206 bones by adulthood. Some bones are also made of soft cartilage, which gradually hardens into bone that peaks in density when a person is in their late 20s. The key ingredient for these processes: calcium.

If your child is no longer breastfeeding, they'll need to regularly eat dairy products to get the calcium they need to help their bones grow strong (plus a dose of many other important nutrients, such as vitamins A, D, protein, and magnesium). Serve children over the age of 2 low-fat or fat-free dairy products.

### Serving sizes
One cup of dairy is considered to be:

- 1 cup milk, yogurt, or calcium-fortified soy milk
- 1 1/2 ounces, two slices, or 1/3 cup shredded hard cheese such as cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, or Parmesan
- 1 ounce processed (American) cheese
- 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
- 2 cups cottage cheese

## Kids ages 2 to 3
**Aim for:** 2 to 2 1/2 cups daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1/2 cup milk with breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for snack, one slice cheddar cheese with lunch, 1/2 cup milk with dinner.
- 1/2 cup milk with breakfast, one slice Swiss cheese at snack time, 1 cup yogurt with dinner.
- 1/2 cup yogurt for breakfast, 1/2 cup milk with lunch, 1/4 cup cottage cheese with berries for snack, 1/3 cup shredded mozzarella with dinner.

## Kids ages 4 to 8
**Aim for:** 2 1/2 cups daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- 1/2 cup milk with breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for snack, 1/2 cup milk and one slice cheddar cheese with lunch, 1/2 cup frozen yogurt for dessert.
- 1/2 cup milk with breakfast, 1/2 cup milk with lunch, one slice of cheese for snack, 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese with dinner.
- 1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese (in eggs or on toast) for breakfast, 1/2 cup milk with lunch, 1 cup yogurt with dinner.

## Protein foods
Protein helps your child's body build new tissues and develop antibodies to ward off infections. Protein foods are also a good source of B vitamins and iron for red blood cell production and central nervous system functioning.

The key is to focus on leaner options. Many animal protein foods are high in saturated fats, which can increase the risk of heart disease later in life. Lean meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs are all better animal sources.

Whether or not your child is vegetarian, incorporate vegetarian sources of protein. These include beans, peas, and lentils (which are also part of the vegetable food group), along with soy products, nuts, and seeds.

### Serving sizes
Count protein in 1-once equivalents, found in:

one egg
- 1 ounce of poultry, lean meat, or fish
- 1 tablespoon of nut butter
- 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds (avoid in kids under 4 years old, as they pose a choking hazard)
- 1/4 cup of cooked beans, peas, or lentils
- 1/8 cup of tofu

Try to serve seafood at least twice a week, since it's an excellent source of brain-boosting DHA and EPA (omega-3 fatty acids). For kids ages 2 to 3 years old, one serving of fish is 1 ounce. For kids ages 4 to 7, a serving is 2 ounces, while it's 3 ounces for 8-year-olds. Salmon, canned tuna, hake, and pollock are all excellent options. Just be sure to skip higher-mercury seafood (king mackerel, tilefish, bigeye tuna, swordfish, marlin, orange roughy, and shark).

## Kids ages 2 to 4
**Aim for:** 2- to 5-ounce equivalents daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- One egg for breakfast, 1/4 cup mashed kidney beans with dinner.
- 1 ounce turkey sausage with breakfast, 1 ounce salmon filet for dinner.
- 2 ounces sliced chicken for lunch, 1 ounce tuna for dinner.

## Kids ages 5 to 8
**Aim for:** 3- to 5 1/2-ounce equivalents daily

**Examples of the daily requirement:**

- One egg for breakfast, 1 ounce sliced turkey with lunch, 1 ounce cooked ground beef with 1/4 cup chili beans for dinner.
- 1/4 cup tofu scramble for breakfast, 1/2 ounce of cashews for snack, 1/4 cup refried beans with dinner.
- 1 tablespoon nut butter with breakfast, one egg for lunch, 1 ounce roast beef and 1/4 cup cooked lentils for dinner.
