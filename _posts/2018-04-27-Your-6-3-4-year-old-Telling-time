## Your 6-year-old now
Here are some telling-time tips:

Have your child count the minute markers to show that there are indeed 60 minutes in an hour. (Since most 6-year-olds can count as high as 200, they should be able to do this.) Most kids will also understand what half of something means. Slice an apple or a pizza in half to illustrate. Then show them that half of 60 is 30. That's the half hour.

Explaining the minute hand and the hour hand can be tricky since it seems backwards (the minute hand is longer than the hour hand). A useful tip: Tell kids that minute is a longer word, so that's the longer hand.

After your child gets this concept, have him practice. Ask what time he goes to bed and have him turn the clock to that hour. When does he eat breakfast? Invest in a cheap watch that lets him put his new knowledge to work.

Moving on from the basics should wait until your child can count by fives and knows what one-fourth of something is.

## Your life now
"Watch me! Watch me!" your child calls as he jumps a ramp with his scooter. Six-year-olds love to learn and show off new tricks. They're fascinated by somersaults, headstands, and the latest dance steps. Jump roping can become an obsession.

These physical feats are more fun now because sixes have the coordination and muscle development to actually do them. Support their adventures and make sure they stay safe. Their judgment won't catch up to their physical capabilities for a while.
