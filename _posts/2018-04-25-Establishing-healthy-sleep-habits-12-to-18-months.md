## Typical sleep at this age
Now your baby is officially a toddler – but they still need as much sleep as they did when they were younger. Until their second birthday, your child should get about 14 hours of sleep a day, 11 of those hours at night. The rest will come in naps.

Your child will still need two naps at 12 months, but by the time they're 18 months old, they may be ready for a single 90-minute to three-hour nap in the afternoon – a pattern they may follow until they're 4 or 5.

The transition from two naps to one can be difficult. Sleep expert Jodi Mindell suggests alternating one-nap and two-nap days, depending on how much sleep your toddler got the night before. You can also try putting your child to bed a little earlier on one-nap days.

## How to establish healthy sleep habits
There's not much new you can do to help your child become a good sleeper at this age, but watch for new issues, such as bedtime resistance, to show up sometime between 18 months and your child's third birthday. Your best bet now: Continue practicing the strategies you've been developing since your child was 6 months old, including:

### Follow a nightly bedtime ritual
A regular bedtime routine helps your child wind down at the end of the day and get ready for sleep. If they need to work off some excess energy, it's okay to let them run around for a little while before moving on to something more calming, such as a quiet game, bath, or bedtime story.

Follow the same pattern every night, even when you're away from home. Toddlers love consistency, and being able to predict when and how something's going to happen helps them feel in control.

### Stick to a consistent schedule
As always, it's also a good idea to set and stick to a consistent bedtime and nap times as part of your daily schedule. If your child naps, eats, plays, and gets ready for bed at about the same time every day, they'll be much more likely to fall asleep without a struggle.

### Make sure your child is able to fall asleep on their own
Don't forget how important it is for your toddler to fall asleep by themself every night. You may want to consider not rocking, nursing, or singing your child to sleep so they'll learn to settle themself back down when they wake up at night. Your child waking up and not being able to get themself back to sleep is less than ideal for you, too – if they do wake up, they'll probably cry for you.

## Potential pitfalls
At this age, your child may have difficulty falling asleep or wake up frequently at night. That could be related to the developmental milestones they're reaching, especially walking. Your toddler is so excited by their new skills that they want to keep practicing, even when you say it's bedtime.

If they resist going to sleep, most experts advise leaving them in their crib for a few minutes to see whether they'll calm down. If not, you may want to consider using some version of the "cry it out" approach.

If you don't want to go that route, it's fine to reassure your child of your presence, but don't turn on the light in their room and don't stay too long. You can try scaling back your responses to them by waiting a little bit longer to go in each time they call and going a little farther from their bed on each visit, until you can reassure them from the doorway without actually going in. Each time, remind them that it's time to go to sleep.

You'll also have to decide what to do if they wake up at night, can't soothe themself back to sleep, and end up crying for you. It's fine to go in and check on or comfort them. But if they want you to stay and play, gently remind them that nighttime is for sleep.

## When to get help
Sleep troubles are common in kids, and sometimes you just need to be patient and wait them out. But if your child has trouble falling and staying asleep then seems sleepy during the day, or has trouble breathing or snores loudly, it's a good idea to check in with their doctor to rule out problems (such as sleep apnea) that can prevent them from getting enough rest.
